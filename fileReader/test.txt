Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install.

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web.

When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue.

To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

Like most kids, mine spend a lot of time on the Internet. As far as I can tell, it’s the thing to do these days. Among this latest generation, computer geeks and gurus seem to be held with the same sort of esteem that rock stars once were by mine. When kids disappear into their rooms, chances are good that they are hacking on computers, not mastering guitar riffs. It’s probably healthier than some of the diversions of my own misspent youth, but that’s a topic for another kind of book.

But if you have teenage kids and computers, or know someone who does, you probably know that it’s not a bad idea to keep tabs on what those kids do on the Web. Type your favorite four-letter word in almost any web search engine and you’ll understand the concern -- it’s much better stuff than I could get during my teenage career. To sidestep the issue, only a few of the machines in my house have Internet feeds.

Now, while they’re on one of these machines, my kids download lots of games. To avoid infecting our Very Important Computers with viruses from public-domain games, though, my kids usually have to download games on a computer with an Internet feed, and transfer them to their own computers to install. The problem is that game files are not small; they are usually much too big to fit on a floppy (and burning a CD takes away valuable game playing time).

If all the machines in my house ran Linux, this would be a nonissue. There are standard command-line programs on Unix for chopping a file into pieces small enough to fit on a floppy (split), and others for putting the pieces back together to recreate the original file (cat). Because we have all sorts of different machines in the house, though, we needed a more portable solution.
